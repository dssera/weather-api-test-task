Use this command to start the project: docker compose up --build

A bit about the API:

1. All services are implemented using asyncio.
2. The service layer is covered by unit tests (also async).
3. When running tests, all operations happen in a test database.
4. Both the app and the database are in Docker containers, which are started by Docker Compose.
